Christopher Hadad spent seven years on Capitol Hill. Started as a scheduler. Ended as Legislative Director for a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. In between, he helped pass three laws and helped coordinate congressional oversight of the IRS. He was working in the Capitol complex on January 6, 2021. He thinks about that day often. About what we owe each other, and how quickly we can forget it.

Before Congress, he studied psychology at Haverford College, where he also played varsity cricket. His senior thesis examined how people with Social Anxiety Disorder can still build meaningful lives. He designed a novel empirical construct to measure how individuals find value across twelve distinct domains of their lives, and explored what clinical strategies might help them get there. The question wasn't academic.

At fourteen, he was awarded a U.S. patent for an ergonomic laptop stand. It has since been cited by major global technology companies.

Divergence is his first novel. It follows a crew that boards humanity's first interstellar mission and wakes three million years in the future to find the universe silent.
