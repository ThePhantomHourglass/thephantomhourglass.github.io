I spent seven years on Capitol Hill. Started as a scheduler, ended as Legislative Director for a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. I helped pass three laws and worked on coordinating congressional oversight of the IRS. I was in the Capitol building on January 6, 2021. I think about that day often—what we owe each other, and how quickly we can forget it.

Before Congress, I studied psychology at Haverford College, where I also played varsity cricket. My senior thesis examined how people with Social Anxiety Disorder can still build meaningful lives—what helps them find value, what gets in the way, and what clinical strategies might bridge the gap. The question wasn't academic.

At fourteen, I was awarded a U.S. patent for an ergonomic laptop stand. It's since been cited by major global technology companies.

Interval is my first novel. It follows a crew that boards humanity's first intergalactic mission and wakes three million years in the future to find the universe silent.
