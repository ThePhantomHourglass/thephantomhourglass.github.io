Allegra Abernathy boards humanity's first intergalactic mission knowing she will never see her wife or her sixteen-year-old son again. She goes anyway.

When the crew wakes, three million years have passed. Earth is silent. Something has spread through realities beyond counting—patient, vast, older than stars. It offered an end to loneliness. Across universes without number, minds said yes.

In that silence, they find John: a sentient probe who has wandered the dead cosmos alone since he rejected his kind's collective consciousness. He can travel through time. Together, they journey across eras to understand what happened.

What they discover is an offer: connection so complete that separation becomes impossible. Peace so total that nothing distinct remains. An end to the distance between minds—and to everything that distance made possible.

The crew must decide what they're willing to lose, and what to destroy, to preserve something uncertain, something painful. The gap between one mind and another.

*A novel about love across the distances that separate us.*
